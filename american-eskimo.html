							<h3>Summary</h3>
							<p>
								Called “the dog beautiful” by his admirers, the American Eskimo Dog, or “Eskie,” is a striking fellow with his white coat, sweet expression, and black eyes. He’s a Nordic dog breed, a member of the Spitz family. Eskies are lively, active companion dogs who love to entertain and join in on all family activities. They are outgoing and friendly with family and friends, but reserved with strangers. Although the Eskie is a small dog — 10 to 30 pounds — he has a big-dog attitude
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h3>Highlight</h3>
							<p>
							Eskies are happy, active, intelligent dogs. They thrive on activity. Plan on keeping your Eskie busy with training classes, games, romps at a dog park, or hikes. A busy Eskie is unlikely to become bored — a state you want to avoid with this breed, because boredom leads to excessive barking, inappropriate chewing, and other annoying behaviors.
